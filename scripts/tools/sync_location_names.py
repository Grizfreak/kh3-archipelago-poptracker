"""
Single entry point to keep location names in sync across all three files that
reference them:
  - scripts/autotracking/location_mapping.lua   (AP_ID -> code, fully regenerated)
  - locations/locations.json                    (the standalone location+section,
                                                    and its mirrored section under
                                                    "<World> - All Checks")
  - scripts/autotracking/autotracking.lua        (OVERWORLD_SECTION_MAP mirror entry)

Each AP id resolves to a (location_name, section_name) pair, i.e. the two
halves of a PopTracker code "@<location_name>/<section_name>":

  1. If the id is listed under "groups" in scripts/tools/location_names.json,
     it shares a hand-curated location pin with other ids (e.g. several
     physically-clustered chests shown as one map pin). location_name is the
     group's key; section_name is exactly what's configured for that id.
     This is how existing curation like "Huddled Isles - Chests 1+21+22"
     (three chest ids, one pin) is preserved -- it is NOT derivable from the
     AP source data and must be maintained by hand in the registry.
  2. Else if the id is listed under "overrides", location_name == section_name
     == the override (a hand-curated friendly rename, e.g. for an opaque
     "Victory Bonus NNN" AP name).
  3. Else location_name == section_name == location_description from the
     source data (for non-treasure types only) or the raw AP name otherwise.

IDs always come from BASE_LOCATION_ID + index in the source "locations" array
(see regenerate_location_mapping.py for how this was verified), independent of
which name is chosen.

locations.json and autotracking.lua are updated with the same string-replace
approach as rename_location.py: only name strings are swapped (once per
distinct old->new pair, so a group rename doesn't get replaced redundantly
once per member id), so access_rules/map_locations/item_count etc. attached
to a section are preserved untouched. This is a blunt global text replace,
same caveat as rename_location.py: re-grep afterwards to confirm nothing
unintended was touched, especially for short/common name fragments.

Usage:
    python scripts/tools/sync_location_names.py --data extracted_locations.json
    python scripts/tools/sync_location_names.py --data extracted_locations.json --dry-run
